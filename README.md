---

## 🌍 Project Overview

“Silent Battles” is a data storytelling initiative focused on raising awareness about **PCOS and Thyroid disorders** — two common yet often underdiagnosed health conditions affecting women.

This project combines:
- Awareness survey insights (Google Forms)
- Health data analysis
- Comparative visualization
- AI-assisted UI design
- Interactive storytelling using Flourish

The goal was to transform health data into a visual and narrative experience that highlights awareness gaps and promotes early detection.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

PCOS and Thyroid disorders often go unnoticed due to:
- Low symptom awareness
- Symptom overlap
- Delayed medical consultation

Our project visualizes:
- Age distribution patterns
- Symptom comparison
- Thyroid type distribution
- Awareness levels among respondents

## 💡 Our Approach

1. Conducted a survey to understand awareness levels  
2. Analyzed health-related datasets  
3. Extracted meaningful statistical insights  
4. Designed UI mockups to structure storytelling flow  
5. Built interactive visualizations using Flourish  

The storytelling flow:

Hook → PCOS Insights → Thyroid Insights → Comparison → Awareness → Hope
